# 💫 About Me:
I am a full-stack developer building AI-native systems that combine intelligent reasoning, scalable backend architecture, and real-world optimization. My work includes Tobi To-Do, a deployed full-stack student productivity platform with integrated AI that organizes tasks, scheduling, and long-term planning through a structured REST API, authentication system, persistent database design, and inference-based recommendation engine. I previously developed Nexora, an AI-powered application featuring secure authentication, API integrations, and real-time user interaction. My portfolio also includes a finance-focused quantitative modeling project exploring portfolio optimization and scenario analysis, an AI + astronomy data project involving data processing, model integration, and analytical visualization, and a Unity-based game built with structured object-oriented scripting and version-controlled development. Across projects, I focus on clean architecture, scalable API design, database integrity, automation, and deploying production-ready systems rather than prototypes.
